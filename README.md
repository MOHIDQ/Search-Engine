# Search Engine


NodeJS Search Engine using ElasticLunr and PageRank algorithms to search through and index data based on website content with their incoming/outgoing links. I used Crawler.js to scrap data off of Wikipedia and the Calreton University Scraping Test Website and stored data on MongoDB. Mainly a Backend project but created a simple frontend to be able to test the REST endpoints and organize the search results + correpsonding website data.
